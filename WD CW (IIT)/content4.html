            <div class="description">
                If you want to start eating more healthily, there are a number of easy changes you can make to your diet.
                <br>
                Here are some healthy eating tips:
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Eat your 5 a day:</b>These nutrient-rich foods are essential for maintaining good health and boosting immunity due to their high content of vitamins and minerals.</li>
                    <li><b>Base meals around high-fibre foods:</b>Opting for a diet abundant in fiber can decrease the risk of conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Opt for wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of pasta, rice, and bread, as they offer more fiber, vitamins, and minerals compared to their refined counterparts.</li>
                    <li><b>Eat a portion of oily fish a week:</b>Oily fish such as salmon and trout are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which support heart health and lower the risk of heart disease.</li>
                    <li><b>Include dairy or dairy alternatives in your diet:</b>Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are excellent sources of calcium, essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth and guarding against osteoporosis. Fortified dairy alternatives, such as oat milk or soy products, also offer similar nutritional benefits, including various vitamins and minerals.</li>
                    <li><b>Eat plenty of legumes:</b>Beans, lentils, and peas are high in protein and fiber while being low in fat, making them ideal for adding bulk to meals and promoting satiety.</li>
                    <li><b>Eat less red meat:</b>While red meat is a valuable protein source, excessive intake, particularly of processed meats like sausages and burgers, can elevate cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease. It's advisable to limit or avoid processed meats and consume red meat in moderation.</li>
                    <li><b>Limit sugary foods and drinks:</b>Foods and drinks high in sugar contribute to obesity and tooth decay. Instead of sugary snacks like cakes, chocolate, and biscuits, opt for healthier alternatives like fruit to satisfy your sweet cravings.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                 <br>
                 Following these healthy eating tips can help you to maintain good health and reap the benefits of a balanced, nutritious diet.

            <div class="topic">Eating healthy plan</div><br>
            <div class="description">
                Designing a nutritious meal plan might seem challenging, particularly when time is limited or you've slipped into unhealthy eating habits for the sake of convenience.
                <br><br>
                It's important to keep in mind to consume ample amounts of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins such as fish or legumes, while minimizing intake of processed foods, sugar, and alcohol.
                <br><br>
                If you find yourself reverting to old habits, don't let it discourage you, and avoid depriving yourself of treats or foods you enjoy. Feeling guilty will only lead to giving up on your goals. Instead, focus on gradually decreasing your consumption of "unhealthy" foods and substituting them with healthier options whenever possible.
